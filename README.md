just another vscode theme ~ a minimal theme done right  
1. doesn't use italic or bold fonts
2. highlights only  
   * keywords (not operators)  
   * functions  
   * strings
   * constants
   * types (not namespaces or modules)
3. for some highlights uses colors that are weak and barely noticable, yet distinct enough to not blend in
